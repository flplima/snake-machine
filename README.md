# Snake Machine

This is a browser-based remake of the classic **Nokia's Snake II**, the best snake game ever, written in TypeScript and using state machines to manage the game logic.

I wrote this game to study and practice XState and state machines in my spare time.

## Play it online

https://snake-machine.vercel.app/

## Getting started

First of all, make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

(you can use npm instead of yarn if you prefer)

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/flplima/snake-machine

# Navigate into the directory
cd snake-machine

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start the development server on port 3000
yarn dev
```

## Technologies

- **XState** for state management and game logic
- **Canvas API** to render the game
- **Vite** to create the development server and build
- **Vercel** to deploy

## TODO

This game is under development and any contribution is welcome!

- Add mazes
- Add speed config
- Add screen buttons to play the game on mobile devices
- Refactor
- Improve typing definition
- Write a documentation
